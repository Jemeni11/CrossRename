CrossRename
===========


Introduction
------------
CrossRename is a tool that helps make your file names work perfectly with your computer.
It doesn't matter if you use Linux, Windows, or both. CrossRename makes sure your file
names follow your computer's rules, so everything runs smoothly.


Why did I build this?
---------------------
I'm a dual-booter running Windows 10 and Lubuntu 22.04. One day (literally yesterday lol),
while transferring a folder between the two systems, I hit a naming roadblock.
Five stubborn files refused to budge, thanks to the quirky differences in
file naming rules between Linux and Windows.

This experience got me thinking. You see, I had previously built
`FicImage <https://github.com/Jemeni11/ficimage>`__, a nifty application
that elevates the reading experience of `FicHub <https://fichub.net/>`__
epubs by adding missing images. It required handling file creation and
renaming, and that knowledge proved invaluable.

And so, CrossRename was born â€“ a tool to simplify your life when managing files between Linux and
Windows. No more naming hassles, just smooth, worry-free file management.


What about Mac ???
